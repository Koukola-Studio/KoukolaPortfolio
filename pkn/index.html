      <h4 class="sideTitle">— Pecha Kucha is a social event originally from Japan that has spread to cities around the world. Currently, it is held in more than 1,000 cities worldwide. Brandýs nad Labem is one of the cities that has the license to host this event. The organizer of Pecha Kucha Night in Brandýs nad Labem is the Klub Srdcařů Foundation.</h4>

  <div id="preparationBlockR">
    <h4 class="sideTitle">— The target group for this event is all age categories. Therefore, both playful and formal symbols were chosen. Pecha Kucha Night is unique in its 20x20 format. During the evening, 8-10 inspirational speakers will take the stage at the Brandýs cinema. Each speaker has 20 slides and 20 seconds for each slide. This makes the whole evening very refreshing and speakers seamlessly alternate on stage. Therefore, symbols that characterize groups of people and connections are also added to the brand strategy.<br><br>

      — The visual identity should be important but also playful. That is why I decided to combine typography that will be complemented by illustrations.<br><br>

  <div id="designBlockR">
    <h4 class="sideTitle">— We have defined the brand strategy. We are now moving on to the main part of designing the visual identity. The visual identity consists of typography that informs about the name of the event (Pecha Kucha Night). I chose a classic and clean font for the logotype, which I stretched for the last word of the event (NIGHT) to define a playful symbol.<br><br>

      — I placed illustrations between the letters of the key word. The illustrations consist of two shapes (circle and line). The combination together symbolizes that the people at this event are connecting and a certain group of people is created who share their experiences with each other.<br><br>
