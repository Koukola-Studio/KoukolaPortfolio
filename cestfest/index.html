    <h4 class="sideTitle">— The target group for this festival is mainly young people. That is why the symbols of playfulness and energy were chosen. Since it is a music festival, the symbols associated with music are also added.<br><br>

      — The logo should be important but playful at the same time. That's why I decided to combine typography with vectors.<br><br>

      — The logo will consist of a logo symbol that can also be used as a standalone object. Then there will be a logotype that will also represent the name of the event.</h4>

    <h4 class="sideTitle">— We have defined the target group and symbol. We're getting to the main part of designing the logo. The logo consists of typography that informs about the name of the event(Šumperský Majáles). For the logotype I chose a classic and clean font that will not interfere with the function of the vector elements.<br><br>

      — There are rounded curves in the vector elements, which give the feeling that it was drawn by a person's hand and these curves define the symbol of playfulness. We'll start with the character first. The character is made up of 2 lightning bolts that define the symbol of energy and 2 lines that define some kind of path.<br><br>

      — Together, the symbols expresses that person is going through a journey at this event where the music is full of energy and never gets tired.</h4>

    <h4 class="sideTitle">— Designing the graphics for the music festival has been a dream of mine for a long time. This year the dream has become a reality and I am very happy. On day of the release, I received a lot of positive feedback. Creating the logo for the music festival was a new and very positive experience for me. I'm definitely looking forward to further collaborations! :-)</h4>
